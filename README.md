# Digit recognition app

An web app created using flask and a deep CNN model to identify hand-drawn digits. You can find the model at CNN folder. 

Deployed the app in heroku at <a href="https://digit-recognition-app.herokuapp.com" target=_blank>https://digit-recognition-app.herokuapp.com</a> (P.S. sometimes, the link takes a while to load). Currently, it is only supported on PCs and laptops.
